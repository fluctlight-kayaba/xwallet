## Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) before proceeding.


## Mobile/native development 
1. Start Metro via `yarn start` command
2. Start Android or iOS via `yarn android` or `yarn ios`

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Browser/web development
1. Launch development server via `yarn dev` command
2. To build/bundle run `yarn bundle`, export/bundled build will be generated in `./metacraft folder`
